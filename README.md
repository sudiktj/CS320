My approach to designing software is that of what does the customer want, where is my starting point, what needs to be done in the middle, and what should the final output be?
I like to ask what is the input? what do you want done with the input? what do you want the end result to be? I then use the answers to these question to find my starting points and build from there. The ultimate way to ensure my code is functional and correct is to test as I go. I like to complete one task and then test it to make sure it works before I move onto the next task.
